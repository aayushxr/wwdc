                  We at DPS Modern Indian School Debate Club aim to empower
                  young minds through the art of debating. This tournament will
                  provide a platform for students to voice out their concerns on
                  matters of deep importance. Not only will this be a learning
                  experience for debaters but also an opportunity to improve
                  their skills of critical thinking and analytical reasoning. We
                  wish to bring the school debating community from all over the
                  world closer, under one platform to spread international
                  brotherhood. <p />{" "}
